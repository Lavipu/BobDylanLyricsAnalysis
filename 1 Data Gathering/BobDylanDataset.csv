You're No Good;1;Bob Dylan;1962;Well, I don't know why I love you like I do Nobody in the world can get along with you You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied When you give me the blues I want to lay down and die I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama I helped you when you had no food to eat Now you're the kind of woman that just don't understand You're taking all my money and give it to another man Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains You're that kind of woman drives a man insane Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied You give me the blues, I want to lay down and die
Talkin' New York;2;Bob Dylan;1962;Rambling out of the wild West Leaving the towns I love the best Thought I'd seen some ups and downs'til I come into New York town People going down to the ground Buildings going up to the sky Wintertime in New York town The wind blowing snow around Walk around with nowhere to go Somebody could freeze right to the bone I froze right to the bone New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years I didn't feel so cold then I swung on to my old guitar Grabbed hold of a subway car And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride I landed up on the downtown side Greenwich Village I walked down there and ended up In one of them coffee-houses on the block Got on the stage to sing and play Man there said, “Come back some other day You sound like a hillbilly We want folk singers here” Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day I blowed inside out and upside down The man there said he loved my sound He was raving about how he loved my sound Dollar a day's worth And after weeks and weeks of hanging around I finally got a job in New York town In a bigger place, bigger money too Even joined the union and paid my dues Now, a very great man once said That some people rob you with a fountain pen It didn't take too long to find out Just what he was talkin' about A lot of people don't have much food on their table But they got a lot of forks 'n' knives And they got to cut something So one morning when the sun was warm I rambled out of New York town Pulled my cap down over my eyes And headed out for the western skies So long, New York Howdy, East Orange

Girl from the North Country;2;The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan;1963;If you're travelin' the north country fair Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline Remember me to one who lives there For she once was a true love of mine If you go when the snowflakes storm When the rivers freeze and summer ends Please see if she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howling winds Please see if her hair hangs long If it rolls and flows all down her breast Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long For that's the way I remember her best I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all Many times I've often prayed In the darkness of my night In the brightness of my day So if you're travelin' the north country fair Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline Remember me to one who lives there For she once was a true love of mine

A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall;6;The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan;1963;Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son? And where have you been, my darling young one? I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-going to fall Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son? And what did you see, my darling young one? I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding I saw a white ladder all covered with water I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-going to fall And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son? And what did you hear, my darling young one? I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-going to fall Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son? And who did you meet, my darling young one? I met a young child beside a dead pony I met a white man who walked a black dog I met a young woman, her body was burning I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow I met one man who was wounded in love I met another man who was wounded in hatred And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-going to fall And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son? And what will you do now, my darling young one? I'm a-going back out 'fore the rain starts a-falling I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest Where the people are many and their hands are all empty Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison And the executioner's face is always well hidden Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten Where black is the color, where none is the number And I'll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinking But I'll know my song well before I start singing And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard It's a hard rain's a-going to fall
Don't Think Twice, It's All Right;7;The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan;1963;Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe If'n you don't know by now And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe It'll never do somehow When your rooster crows at the break of dawn Look out your window and I'll be gone You're the reason I'm a-traveling on But don't think twice, it's all right And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe The light I never knowed And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe I'm on the dark side of the road But I wish there was something you would do or say To try and make me change my mind and stay But we never did too much talking anyway But don't think twice, it's all right So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal Like you never done before And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal I can't hear you anymore I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road I once loved a woman, a child I'm told I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul But don't think twice, it's all right So long, honey babe Where I'm bound, I can't tell Goodbye's too good a word, babe So I'll just say fare thee well I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind You could've done better, but I don't mind You just kinda wasted my precious time But don't think twice, it's all right
Bob Dylan's Dream;8;The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan;1963;While riding on a train going west I fell asleep for to take my rest I dreamed a dream that made me sad Concerning myself and the first few friends I had With half-damp eyes I stared to the room Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon Where we together weathered many a storm Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung Our words was told, our songs was sung Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied Jokin and talkin about the world outside With hungry hearts through the heat and cold We never much thought we could get very old We thought we could sit forever in fun And our chances really was a million to one As easy it was to tell black from white It was all that easy to tell wrong from right And our choices, they were few so the thought never hit That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split How many a year has passed and gone Many a gamble has been lost and won And many a road taken by many a first friend And each one I've never seen again I wish, I wish, I wish in vain That we could sit simply in that room again Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat And I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that
Oxford Town;9;The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan;1963;Oxford Town, Oxford Town Everybody's got their heads bowed down The sun don't shine above the ground I am a-going down to Oxford Town He went down to Oxford Town Guns and clubs followed him down All because his face was brown Better get away from Oxford Town Oxford Town around the bend Come in to the door, he couldn't get in All because of the color of his skin What do you think about that, my friend? Me, my girl, my girl's son We got met with a tear gas bomb I don't even know why we come Going back where we come from Oxford Town in the afternoon Everybody singing a sorrowful tune Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon Somebody better investigate soon
Talkin' World War III Blues;10;The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan;1963;"One time ago a crazy dream came to me I dreamt I was walking to World War Three I went to the doctor the very next day To see what kind of words he could say He said it was a bad dream ""I wouldn't worry about it none, though Them old dreams are only in your head"" I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain” He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane” He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”As I landed on the psychiatric couch He said “Tell me about it” Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast It was all over by a quarter past I was down in the sewer with some little lover When I peeked out from a manhole cover Wondering who turned the lights on us Well, I got up and I walked around Up and down the lonesome town I stood a-wondering which way to go I lit a cigarette on a parking meter And walked on down the road It was a normal day Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell And I leaned my head and I give a yell “Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man”A shotgun fired, and away I ran I don't blame him too much though, he didn't know me Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand I seen a man I said “Howdy friend, I guess there's just us two” He screamed a bit, and away he flew Thought I was a Communist Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave I said “Let's go and play Adam and Eve” I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something? You seen what happened last time they started” Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown There was nobody around I got into the driver's seat And I drove down 42nd Street In my Cadillac Good car to drive after a war Well, I remember seeing some ad So I turned on my Conelrad But I didn't pay the Con Ed bill So the radio didn't work so well Turned on my record player — It was Rock-a-day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa Our Love's A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah” I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue I needed somebody to talk to So I called up the operator of time Just to hear a voice of some kind “When you hear the beep it will be three o'clock” She said that for over an hour And I hung up Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then Saying “Hey I've been having the same old dreams But mine was a little different, you see I dreamt the only person left after the war was me I didn't see you around"" Well, now time passed and now it seems Everybody's having them dreams Everybody sees their self Walking around with no one else ""Half of the people can be part right all of the time And some of the people can be all right part of the time But all of the people can't be all right all of the time"" I think Abraham Lincoln said that“I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours” I said that"

Black Crow Blues;2;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;I woke in the mornin', wandering Weary and worn out I woke in the morning', wandering Weary and worn out Wishin' my long-lost lover Would walk to me, and talk to me Tell me what it's all about I was standin' at the side road Listenin' to the billboard knock Standin' at the side road Listenin' to the billboard knock Well, my wrist was empty But my nerves were kickin' Tickin' like a clock Well I got anything you need, babe Let me tell you in front If I got anything you need, babe Let me tell you in front You can come to me sometime Night time, day time Any time you want Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm Too high to fall Sometimes I'm thinkin' I'm Much too high to fall Other times I'm thinkin' I'm So low I don't know If I can come up at all Black crows in the meadow Sleepin' across a broad highway Black crows in the meadow Across a broad highway Though it's funny, honey I'm outta' touch, don't feel much like a Scarecrow today

With God on Our Side;3;The Times They Are A-Changin';1964;Oh my name it ain't nothin' My age it means less The country I come from Is called the Midwest I's taught and brought up there The laws to abide And that the land that I live in Has God on its side Oh the history books tell it They tell it so well The cavalries charged The Indians fell The cavalries charged The Indians died Ah the country was young With God on its side The Spanish-American War had its day And the Civil War too Was soon laid away And the names of the heroes I's made to memorize With guns in their hands And God on their side The First World War boys It came and it went The reason for fightin' I never did get But I learned to accept it Accept it with pride For you don't count the dead When God's on your side The Second World War Came to an end We forgave the Germans And then we were friends Though they murdered six million In the ovens they fried The Germans now too Have God on their side I've learned to hate the Russians All through my whole life If another war comes It's them we must fight To hate them and fear them To run and to hide And accept it all bravely With God on my side But now we got weapons Of chemical dust If fire them we're forced to Then fire them we must One push of the button And a shot the world wide And ya' never ask questions When God's on your side Through many dark hour I been thinking about this That Jesus Christ Was betrayed by a kiss But I can't think for ya' You'll have to decide Whether Judas Iscariot Had God on his side So now as I'm leavin'I'm weary as Hell The confusion I'm feelin' Ain't no tongue can tell The words fill my head And they fall to the floor If God's on our side He'll stop the next war
Chimes of Freedom;4;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight And for each and every underdog soldier in the night And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched With faces hidden as the walls were tightening As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain Dissolved into the bells of the lightning Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail The sky cracked it's poems in naked wonder That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze Leavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales For disrobed faceless forms of no position Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts All down in taken-for-granted situations Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin' Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look Spellbound and swallowed 'til the tolling ended Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'
One Too Many Mornings;4;The Times They Are A-Changin';1964;Down the street the dogs are barkin' And the day is a-gettin' dark As the night comes in a-falling The dogs will lose their bark And the silent night will shatter From the sounds inside my mind Yes I'm one too many mornings And a thousand miles behind From the crossroads of my doorstep My eyes start to fade And I turn my head back to the room Where my love and I have laid And I gaze back to the street The sidewalk and the sign And I'm one too many mornings And a thousand miles behind It's a restless hungry feeling That don't mean no one no good When everything I'm a-sayin' You can say it just as good You're right from your side I'm right from mine We're both just one too many mornings And a thousand miles behind

North Country Blues;5;The Times They Are A-Changin';1964;Come an' gather 'round friends And I'll tell ya' a tale Of when the red iron ore pits run a-plenty But the cardboard filled windows And old men on the benches Tell you now that the whole town is empty In the north end of town My own children are grown Well I was raised on the other In the wee hours of youth My mother took sick And I was brought up by my brother The iron ore poured As the years passed the door The drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin''Til one day my brother Failed to come home The same as my father before him Well a long winter's wait From the winda' I watched My friends they couldn'ta been kinder And my school it was cut As I quit in the spring To marry John Thomas, a miner Oh the years passed again And the givin' was good With the lunch bucket filled every season What with three babies born The work was cut down To a half a day's shift with no reason Then the shaft was soon shut And more work was cut And the fire in the air, it felt frozen 'Til a man come to speak And he said in one week That number eleven was closin' They complained in the East They're payin' too high They say that your ore ain't worth a-diggin' That it's much cheaper down In the South American towns Where the miners work almost for nothin' So the minin' gates locked And the red iron rotted And the room smelled heavy from drinkin' When the sad silent song Made the hour twice as long As I waited for the sun to go sinking I lived by the window As he talked to himself This silence of tongues it was buildin' 'Til one morning's wake The bed it was bare And I's left alone with three children The summer is gone The ground's turning cold The stores one by one they're a-foldin'My children will go As soon they grow Well there ain't nothin' here now to hold them
Only a Pawn in Their Game;6;The Times They Are A-Changin';1964;A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood A finger fired the trigger to his name A handle hid out in the dark A hand set the spark Two eyes took the aim Behind a man's brain But he can't be blamed He's only a pawn in their game A South politician preaches to the poor white man “You got more than the blacks, don't complain You're better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain And the Negro's name Is used it is plain For the politician's gain As he rises to fame And the poor white remains On the caboose of the train But it ain't him to blame He's only a pawn in their game The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid And the marshals and cops get the same But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool He's taught in his school From the start by the rule That the laws are with him To protect his white skin To keep up his hate So he never thinks straight 'Bout the shape that he's in But it ain't him to blame He's only a pawn in their game From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks And the hoof beats pound in his brain And he's taught how to walk in a pack Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch To hang and to lynch To hide 'neath the hood To kill with no pain Like a dog on a chain He ain't a-got no name But it ain't him to blame He's only a pawn in their game Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught They lowered him down as a king But when the shadowy sun sets on the one That fired the gun He'll see by his grave On the stone that remains Carved next to his name His epitaph plain Only a pawn in their game
To Ramona;6;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;Ramona Come closer Shut softly your watery eyes The pangs of your sadness Will pass as your senses will rise Oh the flowers of the city Though breath-like Get death-like at times And there's no use in trying To deal with the dying Though I cannot explain that in lines Your cracked country lips I still wish to kiss As to be by the strength of your skin Your magnetic movements Still capture the minutes I'm in But it grieves my heart, love To see you trying to be a part of A world that just don't exist It's all just a dream, babe A vacuum, a scheme, babe That sucks you into feelin' like this I can see that your head Has been twisted and fed With the worthless foam from the mouth I can tell you are torn Between staying and returning Back to the South You've been fooled into thinking That the finishing end is at hand Yet there's no one to beat you No one to defeat you 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad I've heard you say many times That you're better than no one And no one is better than you If you really believe that You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose From fixtures and forces and friends Your sorrow does stem That hype you and type you Making you feel That you gotta' be just like them I'd forever talk to you But soon my words Would turn into a meaningless ring For deep in my heart I know there's no help I can bring Everything passes Everything changes Just do what you think you should do And someday maybe Who knows, baby I'll come and be crying to you

Motorpsycho Nightmare;7;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;I pounded on a farmhouse Looking for a place to stay I was mighty, mighty tired I'd come a long, long way I said, “Hey, hey, in there Is there anybody home?” I was standin' on the steps Feeling most alone When out comes a farmer He must've thought that I was nuts He immediate looked at me And stuck a gun into my guts I fell down To my bended knees Saying, “I dig farmers Don't shoot me, please!” He cocked his rifle And begin to shout “Are you that travelin' salesman That I have heard about” I said, “No! No! No!I'm a doctor and it's true I'm a clean-cut kid And I been to college, too” Then in comes his daughter Whose name was Rita She looked like she stepped out of La Dolce Vita I immediately tried to cool it With her dad And told him what a Nice, pretty farm he had He said, “What do doctors Know about farms, pray tell?” I said, “I's born At the bottom of a wishing well” Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails I guess he knew I wouldn't lie He said “I guess you're tired” He said it kind of sly I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles Today I drove” He said, “I got a bed for you Underneath the stove Just one condition You can go to sleep right now That you don't touch my daughter And in the morning, milk the cows” I was sleeping like a rat When I heard something jerkin'There stood Rita Looking just like Tony Perkins She said, “Would you like to take a shower? I'll show you up to the door” I said, “Oh, no! no! I've been through this movie before” I knew I had to split But I did not know how When she said “Would you like to take that shower, now?” Well, I couldn't leave Unless the old man chased me out Because I'd already promised That I'd milk his cows I had to say somethin' To strike him very weird So I yelled out“I like Fidel Castro and his beard” Rita looked offended But she got out of the way As he came charging down the stairs Sayin', “What's that I heard you say?” I said, “I like Fidel Castro I think you heard me right” And I ducked as he swung At me with all his might Rita mumbled somethin' 'bout her mother on the hill As his fist it hit the icebox He said he's gonna kill me If I don't get out the door In two seconds flat“You unpatriotic Rotten doctor Commie rat” Well, he threw a Reader's Digest At my head and I did run I did a somersault As I seen him get his gun And crashed through the window At a hundred miles an hour And landed fully blast In his garden flowers Rita said, “Come back!” As he started to load The sun was coming up And I was running down the road Well, I don't figure I'll be back There for a spell Even though Rita moved away And got a job in a motel He still waits for me Constant, on the sly He wants to turn me in To the F.B.I Me, I romp and stomping Thankful as I romp Without freedom of speech I might be in the swamp
My Back Pages;8;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;Crimson flames tied through my ears Rolling high and mighty traps Pounced with fire on flaming roads Using ideas as my maps “We'll meet on edges, soon,” said I Proud 'neath heated brow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth “Rip down all hate,” I screamed Lies that life is black and white Spoke from my skull, I dreamed Romantic facts of musketeers Foundationed deep, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now Girls' faces formed the forward path From phony jealousy To memorizing politics Of ancient history Flung down by corpse evangelists Un-thought of, though, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now A self-ordained professor's tongue Too serious to fool Spouted out that liberty Is just equality in school“Equality,” I spoke the word As if a wedding vow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand At the mongrel dogs who teach Fearing not that I'd become my enemy In the instant that I preach My existence led by confusion boats Mutiny from stern to bow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats Too noble to neglect Deceived me into thinking I had something to protect Good and bad, I define these terms Quite clear, no doubt, somehow Ah, but I was so much older then I'm younger than that now
When the Ship Comes In;8;The Times They Are A-Changin';1964;"Oh, the time will come up When the winds will stop And the breeze will cease to be breathin' Like the stillness in the wind Before the hurricane begins The hour that the ship comes in And the sea will split And the ships will hit And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking Then the tide will sound And the waves will pound And the mornin' will be a-breakin' The fishes will laugh As they swim out of the path And the seagulls, they'll be smilin' And the rocks on the sand Will proudly stand The hour that the ship comes in And the words that are used For to get the ship confused Will not be understood as they're spoken For the chains of the sea Will have busted in the night And be buried on the bottom of the ocean A song will lift As the mainsail shifts And the boat drifts on to the shoreline And the sun will respect Every face on the deck The hour that the ship comes in Then the sands will roll Out a carpet of gold For your weary toes to be a-touchin' And the ship's wise men Will remind you once again That the whole wide world is watchin' Oh, the foes will rise With the sleep still in their eyes And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin' But they'll pinch themselves and squeal And they'll know that it's for real The hour that the ship comes in And they'll raise their hands Sayin', ""We'll meet all your demands"" But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered"" And like Pharoah's tribe They'll be drowned in the tide And like Goliath, they'll be conquered"
I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met);9;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;I can't understand She let go of my hand And left me here facing the wall I'd sure like to know Why she'd go But I can't get close to her at all Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime She said she would never forget But now morning's clear It's like I ain't here She acts like we never met It's all new to me Like some mystery It could even be like a myth But it's hard to think on That she's the same one That last night I was with From darkness, dreams are deserted Am I still dreaming yet? I wish she'd unlock Her voice once and talk 'Stead of actin' like we never have met If she ain't feelin' well Then why don't she tell 'Stead of turnin' her back to my face? Without any doubt She seems too far out For me to return to or chase Well her skirt it swayed As the guitar played Her mouth was watery and wet But now something has changed For she ain't the same She just acts like we never have met If I didn't have to guess I'd gladly confess To anything I might've tried If I was with her too long Or have done something wrong I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide Though the night ran swirling and whirling I remember her whispering yet But evidently she don't Evidently she won't She just acts like we never have met I'm leavin' today I'll be on my way Of this I can't say very much But if you want me to I can be just like you And pretend that we never have touched And if anybody asks me “Is it easy to forget?” I'll say, “It's easily done You just pick anyone And pretend that you never have met!”

Ballad in Plain D;10;Another Side of Bob Dylan;1964;"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn I courted her proudly but now she is gone Gone as the season she's taken In a young summer's youth, I stole her away From her mother and sister, though close did they stay Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us Of the two sisters, I loved the young With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone By the jealousy of others around her For her parasite sister, I had no respect Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect Countless visions of the other she'd reflect As a crutch for her scenes and her society Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused The changes I was going through can't even be used For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped Noticing not that I'd already slipped To the sin of love's false security From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace Answers of emptiness voice vacancies 'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please What's wrong, what's exactly the matter? And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream At the peak of the night, the king and the queen Tumbled all down into pieces ""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout ""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out""And I in my armor, turning about And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound Her sister and I in a screaming battleground And she in between, the victim of sound Soon shattered as a child to the shadows All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night Leaving all of love's ashes behind me The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet I think of her often and hope whoever she's met Will be fully aware of how precious she is Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me ""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""And I answer them most mysteriously ""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
Restless Farewell;10;The Times They Are A-Changin';1964;Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend Be it mine right or wrongfully I let it slip gladly to my friends To tie up the time most forcefully But the bottles are done We've killed each one And the table's full and overflowed And the corner sign Says it's closin' time So I'll bid farewell and be down the road Oh every girl that ever I've touched I did not do it harmfully And every girl that ever I've hurt I did not do it knowingly But to remain as friends You need the time to make amends And stay behind And since my feet are now fast And point away from the past I'll bid farewell and be down the line Oh every foe that ever I faced The cause was there before we came And every cause that ever I fought I fought it full without regret or shame But the dark does die As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes Must meet the dawn And if I see the day I'd only have to stay So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung But it's not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung But the time ain't tall, if on time you depend And no word is possessed by no special friend And though the line is cut It ain't quite the end I'll just bid farewell 'til we meet again Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time To disgrace, distract, and bother me And the dirt of gossip blows into my face And the dust of rumors covers me But if the arrow is straight And the point is slick It can pierce through dust no matter how thick So I'll make my stand And remain as I am And bid farewell and not give a damn

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums Should I leave them by your gate Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

The Ballad of Ira Hayes;4;Dylan 1973;1973;Gather round you people and a story I will tell About a brave young Indian you should remember well From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms when crops of weeds But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again And when the fight was over and the old glory raised One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

On a Night Like This;1;Planet Waves;1974;On a night like this So glad you came around Hold on to me so tight And heat up some coffee grounds We got much to talk about And much to reminisce It sure is right On a night like this On a night like this So glad you've come to stay Hold on to me, pretty miss Say you'll never go away to stray Run your fingers down my spine Bring me a touch of bliss It sure feels right On a night like this On a night like this I can't get any sleep The air is so cold outside And the snow's so deep Build a fire, throw on logs And listen to it hiss And let it burn, burn, burn, burn On a night like this Put your body next to mine And keep me company There is plenty a-room for all So please don't elbow me Let the four winds blow Around this old cabin door If I'm not too far off I think we did this once before There's more frost on the window glass With each new tender kiss But it sure feels right On a night like this

It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise You came through it all the way, flying through the skies Dark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes Sweet Goddess Born of a blinding light and a changing wind Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been Jack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past The Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast Sweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last Silver Angel With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another notch I'm crestfallen The world of illusion is at my door I ain't a-hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore The prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite Dark Beauty Meet me at the border late tonight

Something There Is About You;5;Planet Waves;1974;Something there is about you that strikes a match in me Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free? Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be Something' that crossed over from another century? Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walk-in' the hills of old DuluthThere was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings Don't have to look no further, you're the soul of many things I could say that I'd be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death Something there is about you that moves with style and grace I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place My hand's on the sabre and you've picked up the baton Something' there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on

Dirge;8;Planet Waves;1974;I hate myself for loving' you and the weakness that it showed You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel I hate myself for loving' you and I'm glad the curtain fell I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed? I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'till he's tame All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet I've paid the price of solitude, but at least I'm out of debt Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees We stared into each other's eyes 'till one of us would break No use to apologize, what difference would it make? So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at I hate myself for loving' you, but I should get over that
You Angel You;9;Planet Waves;1974;You angel you You got me under your wing The way you walk and the way you talk I feel I could almost sing You angel you You're as fine as anything's fine The way you walk and the way you talk It sure plays on my mind You know I can't sleep at night for trying Never did feel this way before I get up at night and walk the floor If this is love then gimme more And more and more and more and more You angel you You're as fine as can be The way you smile like a sweet baby child It just falls all over me You know I can't sleep at night for trying Never did feel this way before Never did get up and walk the floor If this is love then gimme more And more and more and more You angel you You got me under your wing The way you walk and the way you talk It says everything
Never Say Goodbye;10;Planet Waves;1974;Twilight on the frozen lake North wind about to break On footprints in the snow Silence down below You're beautiful beyond words You're beautiful to me You can make me cry Never say goodbye Time is all I have to give You can have it if you choose With me you can live Never say goodbye My dreams are made of iron and steel With a big bouquet Of roses hanging down From the heavens to the ground The crashing waves roll over me As I stand upon the sand Wait for you to come And grab hold of my hand Oh, baby, baby, baby blue You'll change your last name, too You've turned your hair to brown Love to see it hanging' down
Wedding Song;11;Planet Waves;1974;I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love I love you more than money and more than the stars above Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie I'd sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood It's never been my duty to remake the world at large Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge 'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend And if there is eternity I'd love you there again Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see Just being' next to you is a natural thing for me And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on ‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone
Odds and Ends;1;"The Basement Tapes	";1975;Now, I stand in awe and I shake my face You break your promise all over the place You promised to love me, but what do I see? Just you comin' in spilling juice over me Odds and ends, odds and ends Lost time is not found again Now, you take your file and you bend my head I never can remember anything that you said You promised to love me, but what do I know? You're always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go Odds and ends, odds and ends Lost time is not found again Now, I've had enough, my box is clean You know what I'm saying and you know what I mean From now on you'd best get on someone else While you're doing it, keep that juice to yourself Odds and ends, odds and ends Lost time is not found again
Tangled Up in Blue;1;Blood on the Tracks;1975;"Early one morning the sun was shining I was laying in bed Wondering if she'd changed at all If her hair was still red Her folks they said our lives together Sure was going to be rough They never did like Mama's homemade dress Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough And I was standing on the side of the road Rain falling on my shoes Heading out for the East Coast Lord knows I've paid some dues Getting through Tangled up in blue She was married when we first met Soon to be divorced I helped her out of a jam, I guess But I used a little too much force We drove that car as far as we could Abandoned it out West Split up on a dark sad night Both agreeing it was best She turned around to look at me As I was walking away I heard her say over my shoulder ""We'll meet again someday On the avenue"" Tangled up in blue I had a job in the great north woods Working as a cook for a spell But I never did like it all that much And one day the ax just fell So I drifted down to New Orleans Where I lucky was to be employed Working for a while on a fishing boat Right outside of Delacroix But all the while I was alone The past was close behind I seen a lot of women But she never escaped my mind And I just grew Tangled up in blue She was working in a topless place And I stopped in for a beer I just kept looking at the side of her face In the spotlight, so clear And later on, when the crowd thinned out I was just about to do the same She was standing there, in back of my chair Said to me ""Tell me, don't I know your name?""I muttered something underneath my breath She studied the lines on my face I must admit, I felt a little uneasy When she bent down to tie the laces Of my shoe Tangled up in blue She lit a burner on the stove And offered me a pipe ""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said ""You look like the silent type""Then she opened up a book of poems And handed it to me Written by an Italian poet From the thirteenth century And every one of them words rang true And glowed like burning coal Pouring off of every page Like it was written in my soul From me to you Tangled up in blue I lived with them on Montague Street In a basement down the stairs There was music in the cafes at night And revolution in the air Then he started into dealing with slaves And something inside of him died She had to sell everything she owned And froze up inside And when it finally, the bottom fell out I became withdrawn The only thing I knew how to do Was to keep on keeping on Like a bird that flew Tangled up in blue So now I'm going back again I got to get to her somehow All the people we used to know They're an illusion to me now Some are mathematicians Some are carpenter's wives Don't know how it all got started I don't know what they're doing with their lives But me, I'm still on the road A-heading for another joint We always did feel the same We just saw it from a different point Of view Tangled up in blue"
Orange Juice Blues (Blues for Breakfast);2;"The Basement Tapes	";1975;I had a hard time waking this morning I got a lotta things on my mind Like those friends of yours that keep bringing me down Just hangin' round all the time I've had a hard time waking most mornings And it's been that way for a month or more You've had things your way, but now I've got to say On my way out the door Why don't you get right? Try to get right, baby You haven't been right with me Why don't you get right? Try and get right, baby Don't you remember how it used to be? Ooh You had a hard time waking this morning And I can see it in your empty eyes But there's no need for talking or walking 'round the block Just to figure out the reason why I have a hard time handing out warnings I'll just slide on out the door Cuz I'm tired of everything being beautiful, beautiful And I ain't coming back no more But can't you get right? Try to get right, baby You haven't been right with me Why don't you get right? Try and get right baby Don't you remember how it used to be? Ooh
Simple Twist of Fate;2;Blood on the Tracks;1975;They sat together in the park As the evening sky grew dark She looked at him and he felt a spark Tingle to his bones 'Twas then he felt alone And wished that he'd gone straight And watched out for a simple twist of fate They walked alone by the old canal A little confused, I remember well And stopped into a strange hotel With a neon burning bright He felt the heat of the night Hit him like a freight train Moving with a simple twist of fate A saxophone someplace far-off played As she was walking on by the arcade As the light bust through a beat-up shade Where he was wakin' up She dropped a coin into the cup Of a blind man at the gate And forgot about a simple twist of fate He woke up, the room was bare He didn't see her anywhere He told himself he didn't care Pushed the window open wide Felt an emptiness inside To which he just could not relate Brought on by a simple twist of fate He hears the ticking of the clocks And walks along with a parrot that talks Hunts her down by the waterfront docks Where the sailors all come in Maybe she'll pick him out again How long must he wait? One more time, for a simple twist of fate People tell me it's a sin To know and feel too much within I still believe she was my twin But I lost the ring She was born in spring But I was born too late Blame it on a simple twist of fate

Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts;7;Blood on the Tracks;1975;The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down Anyone with any sense had already left town He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin “Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?” Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear“Sorry, darling, that I'm late,” but he didn't seem to hear He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts “I know I've seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself “Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody's shelf” But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere But she'd never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide Was looking to do just one good deed before she died She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts Lily took her dress off, buried it away “Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must Have known it would someday Be careful not to touch the wall, there's a brand-new coat of paint I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint” Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair “There's something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air” He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked And Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes She was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall And cleaned out the bank safe, it's said that they got off with quite a haul In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground For one more member who had business back in town But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink The hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair” Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law But most of all she was thinking 'bout the Jack of Hearts

Shelter from the Storm [Hard Rain];6;Hard Rain;1976;'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death, and men who are fighting to be warm “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved Everything up to that point had been left unresolved Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes an' blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost I took too much for granted, got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove And old men with broken teeth stranded without love Do I understand your question, man, is it hopeless and forlorn? “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation an' they gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm” Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born “Come in,” she said, “I'll give you shelter from the storm”
You're A Big Girl Now [Hard Rain];7;Hard Rain;1976;Our conversation was short and sweet It nearly swept me off-a my feet And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh And you are on dry land You made it there somehow You're a big girl now Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence He's singin' his song for me at his own expense And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh Singin' just for you I hope that you can hear Hear me singin' through these tears Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast Oh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last I can change, I swear, oh, oh See what you can do I can make it through You can make it too Love is so simple, to quote a phrase You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh In somebody's room It's a price I have to pay You're a big girl all the way A change in the weather is known to be extreme But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream? I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh With a pain that stops and starts Like a corkscrew to my heart Ever since we've been apart
I Threw It All Away [Hard Rain];8;Hard Rain;1976;I once held her in my arms She said she would always stay But I was cruel I treated her like a fool I threw it all away Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand And rivers that ran through ev'ry day I must have been mad I never knew what I had Until I threw it all away Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round Love and only love, it can't be denied No matter what you think about it You just won't be able to do without it Take a tip from one who's tried So if you find someone that gives you all of her love Take it to your heart, don't let it stray For one thing that's certain You will surely be a-hurtin' If you throw it all away

Changing of the Guards;1;Street legal;1978;Sixteen years Sixteen banners united over the fields Where the good shepherd grieves Desperate men, desperate women divided Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves Fortune calls I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born On Midsummer's Eve near the tower The cold-blooded moon The captain waits above the celebration Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid Whose ebony face is beyond communication The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid They shaved her head She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo A messenger arrived with a black nightingale I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil I stumbled to my feet I rode past destruction in the ditches With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo Renegade priests and treacherous young witches Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you The palace of mirrors Where dog soldiers are reflected The endless road and the wailing of chimes The empty rooms where her memory is protected Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times She wakes him up Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long golden locks Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes I've moved your mountains and marked your cards But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards Peace will come With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire But will offer no reward when her false idols fall And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating Between the King and the Queen of Swords

Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat);9;Street legal;1978;There's a long-distance train rolling through the rain Tears on the letter I write There's a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much But she's drifting like a satellite There's a neon light ablaze in this green smoky haze Laughter down on Elizabeth Street And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise But he practiced what he preached from the heart A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me The time and the place that we'd part There's a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page Of a book that no one can write Oh, where are you tonight? The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure To live it you had to explode In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed Sacrifice was the code of the road I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John Strong men belittled by doubt I couldn't tell her what my private thoughts were But she had some way of finding them out He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair And discovered her invisible self There's a lion in the road, there's a demon escaped There's a million dreams gone, there's a landscape being raped As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape I won't but then again, maybe I might Oh, if I could just find you tonight I fought with my twin, that enemy within 'Til both of us fell by the way Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees While the law looks the other way Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes The man you were lovin' could never get clean It felt out of place, my foot in his face But he should-a stayed where his money was green I bit into the root of forbidden fruit With the juice running down my leg Then I dealt with your boss, who'd never known about loss Who always was too proud to beg There's a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room And a pathway that leads up to the stars If you don't believe there's a price for this sweet paradise Just remind me to show you the scars There's a new day at dawn and I've finally arrived If I'm there in the morning, baby, you'll know I've survived I can't believe it, I can't believe I'm alive But without you it just doesn't seem right Oh, where are you tonight?

Arthur McBride;10;Good as i been to you;1992;"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride As we went a-walking down by the seaside Mark now what followed and what did betide For it being on Christmas morning Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp And a little wee drummer intending to camp For the day being pleasant and charming ""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried ""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply Intending no harm but meant to pass by For it being on Christmas morning ""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust And drink the king's health in the morning ""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life And he always is blessed with a charming young wife And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife And he always lives pleasant and charming And a soldier, he always is decent and clean In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen While other poor fellows go dirty and mean And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""

""I'll have no such chat And neither will I take it from snappy young brats For if you insult me with one other word I'll cut off your heads in the morning."" And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades When a trusty shillelagh came over their head And bid them take that as fair warning And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides We flung them as far as we could in the tide ""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride ""And temper their edge in the morning!"" And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll And bade it a tedious returning And we having no money, paid them off in cracks We paid no respect to their two bloody backs And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks And left them for dead in the morning And so, to conclude and to finish disputes We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts And bid them look sharp in the morning' Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride As we went a-walking down by the seaside Mark now what followed and what did betide For it being on Christmas morning"

When the Deal Goes Down;4;Modern times;2006;In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light Where wisdom grows up in strife My bewildering brain, toils in vain Through the darkness on the pathways of life Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air Tomorrow keeps turning around We live and we die, we know not why But I'll be with you when the deal goes down We eat and we drink, we feel and we think Far down the street we stray I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by Things I never meant nor wished to say The midnight rain follows the train We all wear the same thorny crown Soul to soul, our shadows roll And I'll be with you when the deal goes down The moon gives light and shines by night I scarcely feel the glow We learn to live and then we forgive O'er the road we're bound to go More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours That keep us so tightly bound You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies And I'll be with you when the deal goes down I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes I followed the winding stream I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys I know they're not what they seem In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain You'll never see me frown I owe my heart to you, and that's saying' it true And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

Workingman's Blues #2;6;Modern times;2006;There's an evening' haze settlin' over the town Starlight by the edge of the creek The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down Money's gettin' shallow and weak The place I love best is a sweet memory It's a new path that we trod They say low wages are a reality If we want to compete abroad My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf Come sit down on my knee You are dearer to me than myself As you yourself can see I'm listening' to the steel rails hum Got both eyes tight shut Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from Creeping it's way into my gut Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind Bring me my boots and shoes You can hang back or fight your best on the front line Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues Now, I'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul Tossed by the winds and the seas I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall I'll sell them to their enemies I'm trying' to feed my soul with thought Gonna sleep off the rest of the day Sometimes no one wants what we got Sometimes you can't give it away Now the place is ringed with countless foes Some of them may be deaf and dumb No man, no woman knows The hour that sorrow will come In the dark I hear the night birds call I can hear a lover's breath I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall Sleep is like a temporary death Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse I can't save a dime I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced Into a life of continual crime I can see for myself that the sun is sinking How I wish you were here to see Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking That you have forgotten me? Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret They waste your nights and days Them I will forget But you I'll remember always Old memories of you to me have clung You've wounded me with words Gonna have to straighten out your tongue It's all true, everything you have heard In you, my friend, I find no blame Wanna look in my eyes, please do No one can ever claim That I took up arms against you All across the peaceful sacred fields They will lay you low They'll break your horns and slash you with steel I say it so it must be so Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue Gonna give you another chance I'm all alone and I'm expecting you To lead me off in a cheerful dance Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife I can live on rice and beans Some people never worked a day in their life Don't know what work even means
Beyond the Horizon;7;Modern times;2006;Beyond the horizon, behind the sun At the end of the rainbow life has only begun In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above Beyond the horizon it is easy to love My wretched heart's pounding I felt an angel's kiss My memories are drowning In mortal bliss Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall Love waits forever for one and for all Beyond the horizon across the divide 'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side Down in the valley the water runs cold Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul I'm touched with desire What don't I do? I'll throw the logs on the fire I'll build my world around you Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game Every step that you take, I'm walking the same Beyond the horizon the night winds blow The theme of a melody from many moons ago The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime Beyond the horizon I found you just in time It's dark and it's dreary I ponder in vain I'm weakened, I'm weary My repentance is plain Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone Beyond the horizon right down to the bone It's late in the season Never knew, never cared Whatever the reason Someone's life has been spared Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Tin Angel;8;Tempest;2012;It was late last night when the boss came home To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne Servant said: “Boss, the lady's gone She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.” “You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man Come to the point as straight as you can”“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand” The boss he lay back flat on his bed He cursed the heat and he clutched his head He pondered the future of his fate To wait another day would be far too late “Go fetch me my coat and my tie And the cheapest labour that money can buy Saddle me up my buckskin mare If you see me go by, put up a prayer” (The Boss) Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day Eastward, long down the broad highway His spirit was tired and his vision was bent His men deserted him and onward he went He came to a place where the light was dull His forehead pounding in his skull Heavy heart was racked with pain Insomnia raging in his brain Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword He renounced his faith, he denied his lord Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall One way or another put an end to it all He leaned down, cut the electric wire Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two It was hard to tell for certain who was who He lowered himself down on a golden chain His nerves were quaking in every vein His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air He ran his fingers through his greasy hair They looked at each other and their glasses clinked One single unit, inseparably linked “Got a strange premonition there's a man close by” (Henry Lee) “Don't worry about him, he wouldn't harm a fly” (The Wife) From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor He moved his feet and he bolted the door Shadows hiding the lines in his face With all the nobility of an ancient race She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise With a hatred that could hit the skies “You're a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes To come this way was by no means wise” (The Wife) “Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench And cover your face or suffer the consequence You are making my heart feel sick Put your clothes back on, double-quick” (The Boss) “Silly boy, you think me a saint I'll listen no more to your words of complaint You've given me nothing but the sweetest lies Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes” (The Wife) “I'd have given you the stars and the planets, too But what good would these things do you? Bow the heart if not the knee Or never again this world you'll see” (The Boss) “Oh, please let not your heart be cold This man is dearer to me than gold” (The Wife) “Oh, my dear, you must be blind He's a gutless ape with a worthless mind” (The Boss) “You've had your way too long with me Now it's me who'll determine how things shall be” (The Wife) “Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed ‘You'll have to try to get past me first” (The Boss) “Do not let your passion rule You think my heart the heart of a fool And you, sir, you can not deny You made a monkey of me, what and for why?” (The Boss) “I'll have no more of this insulting chat The devil can have you, I'll see to that Look sharp or step aside Or in the cradle you'll wish you'd died” (Henry Lee) The gun went boom and the shot rang clear First bullet grazed his ear Second ball went right straight in And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed It would take more than needle and thread Bleeding from the mouth, he's as good as dead “You shot my husband down, you fiend” (The Wife) “Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean? He was a man of strife, a man of sin I cut him down and threw him to the wind” (Henry Lee) This she said with angry breath “You too shall meet the lord of death It was I who brought your soul to life” (The Wife) Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife His face was hard and caked with sweat His arms ached and his hands were wet “You're a murderous queen and a bloody wife If you don't mind, I'll have the knife” (Henry Lee) “We're two of a kind and our blood runs hot But we're no way similar in body or thought All husbands are good men, as all wives know” (The Wife) Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow His knees went limp and he reached for the door His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault My fighting days have come to a halt” (Henry Lee) She touched his lips and kissed his cheek He tried to speak but his breath was weak “You died for me, now I'll die for you” (The Wife) She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through All three lovers together in a heap Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep Funeral torches blazed away Through the towns and the villages all night and all day
Tempest;9;Tempest;2012;"The pale moon rose in its glory Out o'er the Western town She told a sad, sad story Of the great ship that went down T'was the fourteenth day of April Over the waves she rode Sailing into tomorrow To a gilded age foretold The night was black with starlight The seas were sharp and clear Moving through the shadows The promised hour was near Lights were holding steady Gliding over the foam All the lords and ladies Heading for their eternal home The chandeliers were swaying From the balustrades above The orchestra was playing Songs of faded love The watchman, he lay dreaming As the ballroom dancers twirled He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the underworld Leo took his sketchbook He was often so inclined He closed his eyes and painted The scenery in his mind Cupid struck his bosom And broke it with a snap The closest woman to him He fell into her lap He heard a loud commotion Something sounded wrong His inner spirit was saying That he couldn't stand here long He staggered to the quarterdeck No time now to sleep Water on the quarterdeck Already three foot deep Smokestack was leaning sideways Heavy feet began to pound He walked into the whirlwind Sky splitting all around The ship was going under The universe had opened wide The roll was called up yonder The angels turned aside Lights down in the hallway Flickering dim and dull Dead bodies already floating In the double bottom hull The engines then exploded Propellers they failed to start The boilers overloaded The ship's bow split apart Passengers were flying Backward, forward, far and fast They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled Each one more weary than the last The veil was torn asunder 'Tween the hours of twelve and one No change, no sudden wonder Could undo what had been done The watchman lay there dreaming At forty-five degrees He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking Dropping to her knees Wellington he was sleeping His bed began to slide His valiant heart was beating He pushed the tables aside Glass of shattered crystal Lay scattered roundabout He strapped on both his pistols How long could he hold out? His men and his companions Were nowhere to be seen In silence there he waited for Time and space to intervene The passageway was narrow There was blackness in the air He saw every kind of sorrow Heard voices everywhere Alarm-bells were ringing To hold back the swelling tide Friends and lovers clinging To each other side by side Mothers and their daughters Descending down the stairs Jumped into the icy waters Love and pity sent their prayers The rich man, Mister Astor Kissed his darling wife He had no way of knowing Be the last trip of his life Calvin, Blake, and Wilson Gambled in the dark Not one of them would ever live to Tell the tale or disembark Brother rose up 'gainst brother In every circumstance They fought and slaughtered each other In a deadly dance They lowered down the lifeboats From the sinking wreck There were traitors, there were turncoats Broken backs and broken necks The bishop left his cabin To help all those in need Turned his eyes up to the heavens Said, ""The poor are yours to feed"" Davey the brothel-keeper Came out dismissed his girls Saw the water getting deeper Saw the changing of his world Jim Backus smiled He never learned to swim Saw the little crippled child And he gave his seat to him He saw the starlight shining Streaming from the East Death was on the rampage But his heart was now at peace They battened down the hatches But the hatches wouldn't hold They drowned upon the staircase Of brass and polished gold Leo said to Cleo I think I'm going mad But he'd lost his mind already Whatever mind he had He tried to block the doorway To save all those from harm Blood from an open wound Pouring down his arm Petals fell from flowers Tell all of them were gone In the long and dreadful hours The wizard's curse played on The host was pouring brandy He was going down slow He stayed right to the end and he Was the last to go There were many, many others Nameless here forever more They never sailed the ocean Or left their homes before The watchman, he lay dreaming The damage had been done He dreamed the Titanic was sinking And he tried to tell someone The captain, barely breathing Kneeling at the wheel Above him and beneath him Fifty thousand tons of steel He looked over at his compass And he gazed into its face Needle pointing downward He knew he lost the race In the dark illumination He remembered bygone years He read the Book of Revelation And he filled his cup with tears When the Reaper's task had ended Sixteen hundred had gone to rest The good, the bad, the rich, the poor The loveliest and the best They waited at the landing And they tried to understand But there is no understanding For the judgment of God's hand The news came over the wires And struck with deadly force The love had lost its fires All things had run their course The watchman he lay dreaming Of all the things that can be He dreamed the Titanic was sinking Into the deep blue sea"
