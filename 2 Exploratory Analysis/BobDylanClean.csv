   you got something to tell me  tell it to me  man come to the point as straight as you can      old henry lee  chief of the clan came riding through the woods and took her by the hand    the boss he lay back flat on his bed he cursed the heat and he clutched his head he pondered the future of his fate to wait another day would be far too late    go fetch me my coat and my tie and the cheapest labour that money can buy saddle me up my buckskin mare if you see me go by  put up a prayer     the boss  well  they rode all night  and they rode all day eastward  long down the broad highway his spirit was tired and his vision was bent his men deserted him and onward he went he came to a place where the light was dull his forehead pounding in his skull heavy heart was racked with pain insomnia raging in his brain well  he threw down his helmet and his cross handled sword he renounced his faith  he denied his lord crawled on his belly  put his ear to the wall one way or another put an end to it all he leaned down  cut the electric wire stared into the flames and he snorted the fire peered through the darkness  caught a glimpse of the two it was hard to tell for certain who was who he lowered himself down on a golden chain his nerves were quaking in every vein his knuckles were bloody  he sucked in the air he ran his fingers through his greasy hair they looked at each other and their glasses clinked one single unit  inseparably linked    got a strange premonition there a man close by     henry lee     do not worry about him  he would not harm a fly     the wife  from behind the curtain  the boss he crossed the floor he moved his feet and he bolted the door shadows hiding the lines in his face with all the nobility of an ancient race she turned  she was startled

wife     try to escape     he cussed and cursed    you will have to try to get past me first     the boss     do not let your passion rule you think my heart the heart of a fool and you  sir  you can not deny you made a monkey of me  what and for why      the boss     i will have no more of this insulting chat the devil can have you  i will see to that look sharp or step aside or in the cradle you will wish you would died     henry lee  the gun went boom and the shot rang clear first bullet grazed his ear second ball went right straight in and he bent in the middle like a twisted pin he crawled to the corner and he lowered his head he gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed it would take more than needle and thread bleeding from the mouth  he as good as dead    you shot my husband down  you fiend     the wife     husband  what husband  what the hell do you mean  he was a man of strife  a man of sin i cut him down and threw him to the wind     henry lee  this she said with angry breath    you too shall meet the lord of death it was i who brought your soul to life     the wife  then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife his face was hard and caked with sweat his arms ached and his hands were wet    you are a murderous queen and a bloody wife if you do not mind  i will have the knife     henry lee     we are two of a kind and our blood runs hot but we are no way similar in body or thought all husbands are good men  as all wives know     the wife  then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow his knees went limp and he reached for the door his tomb was sealed  he slid to the floor he whispered in her ear     this is all your fault my fighting days have come to a halt     henry lee  she touched his lips and kissed his cheek he tried to speak but his breath was weak    you died for me  now i will die for you     the wife  she put the blade to her heart and she ran it through all three lovers together in a heap thrown into the grave  forever to sleep funeral torches blazed away through the towns and the villages all night and all day;2010s

rode sailing into tomorrow to a gilded age foretold the night was black with starlight the seas were sharp and clear moving through the shadows the promised hour was near lights were holding steady gliding over the foam all the lords and ladies heading for their eternal home the chandeliers were swaying from the balustrades above the orchestra was playing songs of faded love the watchman  he lay dreaming as the ballroom dancers twirled he dreamed the titanic was sinking into the underworld leo took his sketchbook he was often so inclined he closed his eyes and painted the scenery in his mind cupid struck his bosom and broke it with a snap the closest woman to him he fell into her lap he heard a loud commotion something sounded wrong his inner spirit was saying that he could not stand here long he staggered to the quarterdeck no time now to sleep water on the quarterdeck already three foot deep smokestack was leaning sideways heavy feet began to pound he walked into the whirlwind sky splitting all around the ship was going under the universe had opened wide the roll was called up yonder the angels turned aside lights down in the hallway flickering dim and dull dead bodies already floating in the double bottom hull the engines then exploded propellers they failed to start the boilers overloaded the ship bow split apart passengers were flying backward  forward  far and fast they mumbled  fumbled  and tumbled each one more weary than the last the veil was torn asunder  tween the hours of twelve and one no change  no sudden wonder could undo what had been done the watchman lay there dreaming at forty five degrees he dreamed that the titanic was sinking dropping to her knees wellington he was sleeping his bed began to slide his valiant heart was beating he pushed the tables aside glass of shattered crystal lay scattered roundabout he strapped on both his pistols how long could he hold out  his men and his companions were nowhere to be seen in silence there he waited for time and space to intervene the passageway was narrow there was blackness in the air he saw every kind of sorrow heard voices everywhere alarm bells were ringing to hold back the swelling tide friends and lovers clinging to each other side by side mothers and their daughters descending down the stairs jumped into the icy waters love and pity sent their prayers the rich man  mister astor kissed his darling wife he had no way of knowing be the last trip of his life calvin  blake  and wilson gambled in the dark not one of them would ever live to tell the tale or disembark brother rose up  gainst brother in every circumstance they fought and slaughtered each other in a deadly dance they lowered down the lifeboats from the sinking wreck there were traitors  there were turncoats broken backs and broken necks the bishop left his cabin to help all those in need turned his eyes up to the heavens said   the poor are yours to feed  davey the brothel keeper came out dismissed his girls saw the water getting deeper saw the changing of his world jim backus smiled he never learned to swim saw the little crippled child and he gave his seat to him he saw the starlight shining streaming from the east death was on the rampage but his heart was now at peace they battened down the hatches but the hatches would not hold they drowned upon the staircase of brass and polished gold leo said to cleo i think i am going mad but he would lost his mind already whatever mind he had he tried to block the doorway to save all those from harm blood from an open wound pouring down his arm petals fell from flowers tell all of them were gone in the long and dreadful hours the wizard curse played on the host was pouring brandy he was going down slow he stayed right to the end and he was the last to go there were many  many others nameless here forever more they never sailed the ocean or left their homes before the watchman  he lay dreaming the damage had been done he dreamed the titanic was sinking and he tried to tell someone the captain  barely breathing kneeling at the wheel above him and beneath him fifty thousand tons of steel he looked over at his compass and he gazed into its face needle pointing downward he knew he lost the race in the dark illumination he remembered bygone years he read the book of revelation and he filled his cup with tears when the reaper task had ended sixteen hundred had gone to rest the good  the bad  the rich  the poor the loveliest and the best they waited at the landing and they tried to understand but there is no understanding for the judgment of god hand the news came over the wires and struck with deadly force the love had lost its fires all things had run their course the watchman he lay dreaming of all the things that can be he dreamed the titanic was sinking into the deep blue sea;2010s
